<h1>Free Tennis</h1>













<h2>How to play</h2>













<p>This is a tennis <span style="font-style: italic;">simulation</span>, not an arcade. You play with the mouse and
five keys. Five keys may seem overwhelming, but you can play very well with <em>no</em> keys at all! The keys are meant for experts
(e.g. to change the shot height, to sprint, to dive, to do backspin),
and can be learned to use gradually.

The five keys are X, Z, D (on the keyboard) plus the two mouse
buttons.</p>













<p>The meaning of mouse movements and buttons depends on the
"game phase". We can identify three game phases:</p>













<ol>













  <li>service phase: your player is serving;</li>













  <li>feet movement phase: in this phase the mouse controls the
feet of your player;</li>













  <li>aiming phase: in this phase you use the mouse to aim (i.e.
decide
where the ball will fall), while the feet of your player are controlled
by the A.I. You can tell you are in aiming phase because you see the
shot parabola (see screenshots).</li>













</ol>













<p>The meaning of controls is the following:</p>













<h3>During the service phase</h3>













<p>The meaning of the mouse movement is the following:</p>













<ul>













  <li>right and left movement: changes the direction of the
service. Up and down movement: does nothing.</li>













</ul>













<p>The meaning of the four keys is the following:</p>













<ul>













  <li>left mouse button: play a first service (powerful)</li>













  <li>right mouse button: play a second service (sliced, slower
and more safe).</li>













  <li>other keys: they do nothing.</li>













</ul>













<h3>During the feet movement phase</h3>













<ul>













  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>mouse cursor: controls your feet. So, for example, if you
move
the mouse to the right, the player will take a small step to the right.</p>










    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>
Please
note: the mouse does not control the speed of your movement, only the
direction. The speed of movement is fixed and depends on the chosen
player (though it can be increased temporarily by sprinting --- see
below). So, <span style="font-weight: bold;">moving the mouse a big amount won't make your player move
faster</span>.</p>










  </li>
















  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>X: sprint. By sprinting, you&nbsp;increase a lot the <span style="font-style: italic;">speed</span> of
movement, but you decrease the ability to change the <span style="font-style: italic;">direction</span> of movement. Sprinting is fundamental to approach the net quickly.&nbsp;<br>









    </p>









    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>Here is how it works: when you press X, the current mouse
direction is <span style="font-style: italic;">locked</span>,
and the player starts sprinting in that direction.
As long as you keep X pressed, you can alter the running direction only
slightly, by moving the mouse. When you release X, the
sprint ends, and you can once again control your feet fully with the
mouse.<br>









    </p>









Note:
sprint energy is limited: it is just enough to help you take the
net when starting from the baseline. So, use it sparingly. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">yellow bar</span> to the right side of the screen tells you how much sprint energy you have left.&nbsp;
  </li>













  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>D: dive. Only for experts. Your player will dive left or right (the direction
is
chosen automatically). You should only use "D" under net, to catch a
passing shot you can't reach otherwise.&nbsp;<br>

As a visual aid, sometimes <span style="font-weight: bold;">your
player&nbsp;turns yellow</span>. Yellow means "if you press D now, your
dive will succeed". In other words, yellow means you are in case
(2). Pressing "D" when your player is not yellow is useless:
you will miss
the ball.

    </p>









    
    
    






  </li>













</ul>













<h3>During the aiming phase</h3>













<ul>













  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>mouse cursor: controls the place where the ball should
bounce.</p>










  </li>










  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>left mouse button: decreases the height of the shot over
the net. Note that decreasing the height makes the trajectory more straight, and therefore <span style="font-weight: bold;">it makes the shot faster</span> (since the gravity is constant). Decreasing the height is very <span style="font-weight: bold;">important in passing shots</span> because, if your shot is low above the net, the opponent will be unable to play a powerful volee.&nbsp;</p>










  </li>










  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>right mouse button: increases the height of the shot over
the net.</p>










  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>Z: change the spin of the current shot from topspin to
backspin.
This key must be pressed before the player has begun the shot gesture.
If the gesture has already begun, the key does nothing.</p>










  </li>












  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>other keys: they do nothing.</p>










  </li>













</ul>













<h2>Other keys that work during game<br>













</h2>













<p>
Note: <span style="font-weight: bold;">as soon as the game starts, you need to press either "F" or "G"</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">








<span style="font-weight: bold;">




to activate mouse input</span>. See below.<br>













</p>













<ul>













  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>F : Enter fullscreen mode and start
listening to mouse input. Press
again to exit fullscreen mode.</p>










  </li>










  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>G : Hide the mouse cursor and start listening to
mouse input. You only need to press this in order to play in a window, without
entering fullscreen. Press again to release mouse input.</p>



  </li>



  <li>
    
    
    
    <p>I : increase the average <span style="font-weight: bold;">camera height</span>. Use this to have an eagle-eye view.</p>



  </li>



  <li>
    
    
    
    <p>K : decrease&nbsp;the average camera height. Use this to make the game more immersive.</p>



  </li>










  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>ESC: exit the game</p>










  </li>










  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>-: decrease the game speed (<span style="font-weight: bold;">slow motion, useful
for newbies</span>)</p>










  </li>










  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>0: increase the game speed.</p>










  </li>










  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>P : pause the game.</p>










  </li>













</ul>













<h2>The players</h2>













<p>Currently, you can choose among 3 players: Pete, Mats and Ivan. The
following descriptions are only valid if you enable the
"-realistic" flag (see below).</p>













<ul>













  <li>Ivan. Powerful groundstrokes. Heavy topspin (curved
parabola) and therefore good angles. Fast. Weak at volee.</li>













  <li>Mats. Not powerful but very precise groundstrokes. Very
heavy topspin (curved parabola) and therefore very good
angles. Very fast. Average at volee.</li>













  <li>Pete. Powerful at groundstrokes, but not precise. Flat
strokes (flat parabola). Average speed. Very precise at volee.</li>













</ul>













<h2>Command line options</h2>













The game must be started by command line. The minimal command line is
<pre>./freetennis -newbie</pre>













which will start a human-vs-computer match, on cement, with players
equal to Ivan and Ivan.<br>













<h3>Choosing the players</h3>













You choose the player with the -p0 and -p1 command line
options. For example:
<pre>&nbsp;./freetennis -p0 ivan -p1 pete</pre>













<p>The default is "ivan". Case does not matter.</p>













<p>These options are ignored when the "-client" option is used.</p>













<h3>Choosing the court surface</h3>













You can choose among three surfaces: Clay, Grass and Cement. [insert
descriptions here].
<p>You specify the court surface with the option -surf. Example:</p>













<pre>./freetennis -surf cement</pre>













<p>The default is "cement".</p>













<p>This option is ignored when the "-client" option is used.</p>













<h3>Playing human vs computer<br>













</h3>













<p>
This is the default. You don't need to pass any special option to start
a human-vs-computer match. Only, remember that player
0
is the human, player 1 is the computer. </p>













<p>For example, if you want to play with Ivan against Pete, type</p>













<pre>./freetennis -p0 ivan -p1 pete</pre>













<p>and the computer will impersonate Pete, whereas you will
impersonate Ivan.</p>













<h3>Playing human vs human</h3>













<p>In order to play human vs human, you need two PCs connected
via a network (either LAN or Internet). One of the PC must act as a
server, the other as a client.&nbsp;</p>













<p>The server must be started this way:<br>













</p>













<pre>./freetennis -server -port yyyy</pre>













<p>
where yyyy is a free TCP port in your network (e.g. 8080). The port
must be chosen according to which ports your firewall makes
available.</p>













<p>The client must be started this way:</p>













<pre>&nbsp; ./freetennis -client xx.xx.xx.xx&nbsp; -port yyyy</pre>













<p>where xx.xx.xx.xx is the IP address of the server (e.g.
192.168.1.33), and yyyy is the same port specified by the server.<br>













</p>













<p>The option "-port" can be omitted, in which case a default
port of 4000 is used.&nbsp; You may have to configure your
firewall to open that port. The client does not have this problem.</p>













<p>In human-vs-human mode, the players and surface are decided
by
the server. The -surf and -pXname options are ignored by the
client.</p>













<p>Example: in order to start a match Ivan vs. Pete, on the
grass, you should type</p>













<pre>./freetennis -p0 ivan -p1 pete -surf grass -server -port yyyy</pre>













<p>on the server, and</p>













<pre>./freetennis -client -port yyyy</pre>













<p>on the client.</p>













<h3>Making the game realistic</h3>













<p>
In this section we'll talk about the "-realistic" and "-newbie" flags.
These flags are mutually exclusive, and you must
specify one of them (there is no default). Their meaning is the
following.</p>













<p>In real tennis, these 3 rules hold:</p>













<ol>













  <li>players who are powerful are usually not precise, and
viceversa;</li>













  <li>some players are more skilled at net, others at
groundstrokes;</li>













  <li>fast shots are more difficult to respond to.</li>













</ol>













<p>
So, for the game to be realistic, those rules must somehow hold; that
is, aiming must be more difficult if the opponent's shot is
fast, if you are not very good at that shot, or if you are very
powerful.</p>













<p>This happens when you choose the -realistic flag.&nbsp; If
you use
it, the parabola becomes more or less visible, according to the
situation, so as to satisfy the 3 rules.
</p>













<p>The -realistic flag makes the game much more amusing, but also
more difficult for newbies (it is more difficult to aim). So it
should be avoided when learning (in which case you should use the
-newbie flag).</p>













<p>Note: without the -realistic flag, some players are much more
convenient to use than others. With -realistic, each player
has its own strength and weakness, and the game is more fair.</p>













<h3>Choosing the difficulty level</h3>













<p>This only makes sense if you are playing human vs computer.
The option to use in this case is -computerskill. Example:</p>













<pre>./freetennis -computerskill 200</pre>













<p>The number must be between 0 and 250. 0 is very difficult, 250
is very easy.</p>



<h3>Choosing the resolution</h3>













<p>Use the options -xres and -yres. Example:</p>













<pre>./freetennis -xres 400 -yres 300</pre>













<h3>
Miscellaneous examples</h3>













<pre>./freetennis -realistic<br>./freetennis -p0 pete -realistic<br>./freetennis -p0 mats -p1 ivan -newbie<br>./freetennis -surf cement -computerskill 200 -realistic<br>./freetennis -client 192.168.1.33 -xres 400 -yres 300  -realistic<br>./freetennis -server -p0 ivan -p1 ivan -surf clay -realistic -nosound<br></pre>













<h2>Miscellanea</h2>













<ul>












  <li>
    
    <p>Sometimes <span style="font-weight: bold;">your player turns red</span>. This means "I can't reach the
ball, it is too far". In this case, all you can try is sprinting
(with the appropriate key, see above). If, by sprinting, you can get
close enough to the ball, automatic search will start. But this is
not guaranteed: sprinting may not suffice if the ball is very
far
(and this happens most of the time).</p>

  </li>












  <li>
    
    <p>There is no tournament mode. Only single matches. And there is no doubles.</p>

  </li>












  <li>
    
    <p>The match does not end until you press "ESC".</p>













  </li>












  <li>In the future, more players will be added, and each player
will have his own visual gestures.<br>













  </li>












</ul>
