<h1><font color="#ff0808">Free tennis: obtaining the
program</font></h1>





<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Currently,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Free Tennis</span>
is only available as source code.  You'll have to download it, then compile it.</p>
<p><small>(An ebuild for gentoo seems to be available <a href="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-2892430.html">here</a>)</small></p>





<h2>Downloading the source code</h2>


<small></small>


<p> There are two ways to get the source code: the latest official
release and the CVS repository. The version in CVS usually has more
features, and it might have more, as well as fewer, bugs than the
official source release. To discover which version is best for you,
consult the two changelogs in the home page,
which show the difference between the CVS version and the latest
official release.
</p>





<h3>Official source release</h3>





The latest source release is available <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=150502">here</a>.
<h3>Latest snapshot - CVS</h3>





To get the latest source code, you must use a program called CVS. Under
GNU/linux, just install CVS, which comes with most distributions, then
open a terminal and copy&amp;paste this text:
<pre>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/freetennis checkout freetennis<br></pre>





<p>This will create a directory called <span style="font-family: monospace;">freetennis </span>in
your current
directory, and put the source code in it.
</p>





<h2>Compiling the source code</h2>


 Instructions for compiling (and
info about the required dependencies) are available <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/freetennis/freetennis/INSTALL.txt">
here</a>.

<p> The compilation was tested under Ubuntu GNU/Linux and Debian Sarge
GNU/Linux, but it should be possible to compile under Windows, since
portable libraries have been used.
