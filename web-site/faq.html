<h2>I can't start playing. Both players seem to be computer-driven.</h2>



When
the game start, you need to press either F or G to activate the mouse
input. Read the manual to know the difference between F and G. 
<h2>Can I play human-vs-human?<br>



</h2>



<p>You can, but you need two computers connected via LAN or internet.
Read the manual to know how to start a game in human-vs-human mode.</p>



<h2>Why can't I play human-vs-human on a single machine?</h2>



<p>I considered allowing this but, after making tests, I decided
against. Here's what happens when two humans play on a single computer:</p>



<ul>



  <li>the opponent&nbsp;sees where you are aiming (your parabola is
visible). So he&nbsp;moves there before you hit the ball. This results
in a distorted gameplay;</li>



  <li>who plays in the bottom half of the screen has too big an advantage;</li>



  <li>who uses the mouse has too&nbsp;big an advantage over who uses the keyboard or joypad.</li>



</ul>



<h2>Network games across the internet are too slow.</h2>



Yes, you probably need a very fast internet connection to play human-vs-human via internet. I don't have one so I can't tell.<br>



<p>Via LAN,&nbsp;however, the game is fast enough. </p>



In the future, I will try to group packets or send fewer packets, in
order to make internet matches playable too.&nbsp;I still don't know if
this is possible.<br>



<h2>How "finished" is this game?</h2>



The computer A.I. is not finished, so please don't judge the gameplay
in human-vs-computer mode until version 1.0 is released. I decided to
release an incomplete game because in human-vs-human mode it is already
enjoyable.<br>



<h2>What does it mean when the player becomes red?</h2>



That question is answered in the manual (in <span style="font-weight: bold;">bold</span> text).<br>



<h2>What does it mean when the player becomes yellow?</h2>



That question is answered in the manual (in <span style="font-weight: bold;">bold</span> text).<br>


<h2>The game is too difficult!</h2>


So is tennis! :-) <br>

Beginners should use the slow motion feature (see manual). Another
thing you should try is change the difficulty with the -computerskill
option.<br>


<br>


This game is meant to&nbsp;be difficult to learn but&nbsp;rewarding once you did --- kind of like Kick Off 2.<br>
<h2>Sometimes the game crashes and the mouse does not respond anymore.</h2>
Sorry, I am currently not sure how to restore the mouse&nbsp;after a crash. Ideally, the game should not crash ;-)<br>
What I do when this happens is the following: activate the terminal
with ALT-TAB; press "up arrow" and "enter" so as to execute freetennis
again; when freetennis starts, press G or F in order to activate mouse
input; press "esc" to quit freetennis; you are now back to X with a
working mouse cursor. If needed, you can now restore the resolution.<br>
<h2>Sometimes I get an error about "port binding" when starting two player mode with -server</h2>
I hope to fix this soon. If you get this error, wait a few minutes or
(better) just change the port number with the -port option. Of course,
the client should change the port too.
