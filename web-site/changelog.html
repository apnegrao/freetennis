<h1>Changelog - Free Tennis<br>

</h1>

<h2>New in 0.4.8</h2>

<ul>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Easier compilation:</span>
gtkglarea is not&nbsp;needed to compile the game anymore. If you were unable to
compile because of an <span style="font-weight: bold;">error "unbound
value GlGtk.region_of_raw"</span>,
try again. Similarly, if the precompiled executable does not run
because you are missing the library "libgtkgl-2.0", try again.
    <p>
More informations: now your lablgtk2 does not need to be compiled with
gtkglarea anymore. Only Debian and Ubuntu seemed to be doing that.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>New in 0.4.7</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Fixed bug: the slow-motion keys had stopped working since
version 0.4.5.</li>

</ul>

<h2>New in 0.4.6</h2>

<ul>

  <li>AI:
    <p>Fixed <span style="font-weight: bold;">major
bug</span>: when winning a passing shot, computer would believe
he had won two balls, and would update his tactics accordingly. On the
log run, he would wrongly prefer not to take the net. </p>

    <p>Fixed minor bug: when human wins with a volee and computer
is
close to the net, computer would wrongly believe he had lost a ball
taking the net, and update tactics. </p>

  </li>

</ul>

<h2>New in 0.4.5</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">fixed major
bug </span>that prevented the game to work on fast computers
(player
would not serve). </p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <p>AI: the computer is now more forgiving under net.</p>

  </li>

  <li>gameplay: tuned player speeds. There was too big a
difference between the speed of Mats and that of Pete.</li>

</ul>

<h2>New in 0.4.4</h2>

<ul>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gameplay
tuning</span>:<br>

    <p>players
are now slower. Therefore, shots which are close to the line pay more;
in addition, it is now reasonably easy to place a killing
diagonal&nbsp; (previously it wasn't). Overall, this makes the
game&nbsp;more
realistic;</p>

    <p>increased the vertical sprint speed;</p>

    <p>decreased parabola visibility;</p>

    <p>tuned bounce speed on all surfaces;</p>

    <p> made dropshots and drop volleys easier; </p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">AI tuning:</span>
    </p>

    <p> better logic in choosing between "approaching
attack"
and
"attack with power shot"; </p>

    <p>better logic choosing a volee: computer now plays an
approaching volee when he is far from the net; </p>

    <p>computer now approaches the net with a slower
shot, in order to have more time to reach the net; </p>

    <p>computer tries to get closer to the
net than it did before, in order to play a stronger volee; </p>

    <p>computer's passing shot is not so low and
precise as it was before; </p>

    <p>several other improvements.</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Fixed bug in AI: when your service went out, computer
would believe to have won a ball by not attacking, and would update his
tactic accordingly.</p>

  </li>

</ul>

<h2>New in 0.4.3</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Fixed crash. When smashing particularly close to the net,
computer would sometimes be unable to find a feasible shot.</li>

  <li>
    <p>Control gameplay: new logic to prevent dropshot from being
too easy.</p>

  </li>

</ul>

<h2>New in 0.4.2</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Like 0.4.1, except that the bug is really fixed.</li>

  <li>
    <p>AI: the computer-driven player uses more sprint to get
back to center.</p>

  </li>

</ul>

<h2>New in 0.4.1</h2>

<ul>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixed major
bug</span>: when
playing a&nbsp;volley with a very low impact point, or very close
to
the net,&nbsp;your initial shot would appear too long and
impossible to
put in. Happened especially with Ivan.</li>

</ul>

<h2>New in 0.4</h2>

<ul>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Major gameplay</span>:
placing
an unreachable dropshot is not so easy anymore. If you make your
parabola hit the ground too vertically, you are likely to hit net.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>

  <li>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Major
graphics</span>: computer
now moves towards the ball even&nbsp;when he knows he can't reach
it,
or when it is going out. This way you don't know&nbsp;you won the
point
until the very last moment. This increases realism and was a requested
feature.</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Major AI</span>:
computer now sprints to get back to center when he is very
decentered horizontally. This affects gameplay, because moving the
computer with a short diagonal and then place
a killing down-the-line is not so easy anymore.</p>

  </li>

  <li>Fixed rare crash: do a very short dropshot (backspin) which
dies
close to the net, and the computer would not find a candidate impact
point.</li>

  <li>
    <p>Fixed rare crash (human player unable to create a suitable
initial aim).</p>

  </li>

  <li>You now get a visual feedback on fault (not just a sound).</li>

  <li>
    <p>AI: the computer player would favour a volee close to the
net
even though he did not want to take the net at that time, and he was
close to the baseline.</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <p>AI tuning (Pete's interlocutory shot)</p>

  </li>

</ul>

<h2>New in 0.3.15</h2>

* Fixed crash (the human player was unable to find a good initial<br>

&nbsp; trajectory on forwards strech shot).<br>

<br>

* AI - Fixed bug. The computer-driven player was updating his tactics<br>

&nbsp; only in those games when he was serving.<br>

<br>

* AI: ivan, on the clay, was doing interlocutory shots that were too<br>

&nbsp; short and not rewarding on that surface.<br>

<br>

<h2>New in 0.3.14</h2>

<br>

* <span style="font-weight: bold;">major AI</span>:
computer now learns whether it is best to take the net or<br>

&nbsp; to stay back. Affects gameplay.<br>

<br>

* gameplay tuning: computer is more forgiving in passingshot; computer<br>

&nbsp; covers the diagonal more when at net; decreased running
speed of<br>

&nbsp; mats; improved Pete's logic in choosing the shot; <br>

<br>

<br>

* gameplay: sometimes the (linux) kernel would halt the game for a few<br>

&nbsp; milliseconds (e.g. when swapping memory). Then, when the
game would<br>

&nbsp; resume, the ball would travel too much in a single frame,
making it<br>

&nbsp; impossible to reach. This is now fixed with a new algo for<br>

&nbsp; calculating the amount of time passed since the last frame.<br>

<br>

* AI: changed logic with which _human_ players choose the impact<br>

&nbsp; point. High impacts are preferred. This implies your passing
shots<br>

&nbsp; will be faster (since your impact is higher, your shot will
be more<br>

&nbsp; straight and therefore more powerful).<br>

<br>

* crash fixed: sometimes the game would crash on volee, especially<br>

&nbsp; with ivan. (the reason was that the default trajectory was
too<br>

&nbsp; vertical).<br>

<br>

* control logic: if you increase the shot height (right mouse button),<br>

&nbsp; and the resulting shot happens to be too vertical, then the
shot<br>

&nbsp; length is increased as well. This makes lob more difficult
and more<br>

&nbsp; realistic.<br>

<br>

* bug fixed. Sometimes the initial shot was stuck, i.e. impossible to<br>

&nbsp; change.<br>

<br>

* sound engine improved. If -nosound is given, there is no attempt to<br>

&nbsp; initialize the sound system. This might (and might not)
allow those<br>

&nbsp; people who have trouble with the sound driver to play.<br>

<br>

* improvement for distro packagers: you can now customize the location<br>

&nbsp; of the graphics and sfx dir by editing the first two lines of<br>

&nbsp; freetennis.ml<br>

<br>

* changed default surface to cement: on the clay, newbies may find it<br>

&nbsp; too difficult to place a killing shot.<br>

<br>

<h2>New in 0.3.7</h2>

<br>

* major bug fixed: sometimes, especially on volleys, the initial aim<br>

&nbsp; would be impossible to change. This is now fixed.<br>

<br>

* major bug fixed: in two player mode, after starting the game once,<br>

&nbsp; the server would refuse to start again unless you change the
port or<br>

&nbsp; wait a minute.<br>

<br>

* gameplay: tuned various attibutes (running speed of Pete, player<br>

&nbsp; speed under net, bounces on the grass, computer passingShot
skill,<br>

&nbsp; computer sprint speed...)<br>

<br>

* graphics: the court lines and net ribbon are drawn with a less<br>

&nbsp; saturated color. More realism.<br>

<br>

* AI: improvements in choosing the shot<br>

<br>

* gameplay: slightly improved the mouse input logic: players who are<br>

&nbsp; weak at net have more trouble managing powerful passing
shots. More<br>

&nbsp; realistic.<br>

<br>

<br>

* tuned fps calculation, so that the game is now smoother at high<br>

&nbsp; refresh rates.<br>

<br>

* bug fixed: the human player was able to respond to service with a<br>

&nbsp; volley.<br>

<h2>New in 0.3.5</h2>

<br>

* gameplay: it is now possible to finetune the camera height with the<br>

&nbsp; keys I and K.<br>

<br>

* new camera algorithm. The camera is steadier and oscillates<br>

&nbsp; less. Also, the camera gets lower when you take the net.
Finally,<br>

&nbsp; there is a more clever logic to determine whether the player
covers<br>

&nbsp; the net and should therefore be transparent.<br>

<br>

* bug fixed: in 2d mode, on the client, the player below would appear<br>

&nbsp; behind the net ribbon (wrong drawing order).<br>

<br>

* fixed minor bug in event management which caused slight delays in<br>

&nbsp; the response.<br>

<br>

* bug fixed: the extent to which you can alter the running speed<br>

&nbsp; during sprint was dependent on frame rate.<br>

<br>

* gameplay: lob is not so easy anymore.<br>

<br>

* AI: the computer-driven player does not do smashes that are<br>

&nbsp; unrealistically weak anymore.<br>

<br>

* the string "too late" does not overlap the score anymore.<br>

<br>

<h2>New in 0.3</h2>

<br>

<br>

* major bug fixed: on slow computers, the game was totally unplayable<br>

&nbsp; because mouse input would be ignored for aiming (though not
for<br>

&nbsp; moving).<br>

<br>

* major bug fixed: in 2player mode, sometimes the game would hang or<br>

&nbsp; crash at startup; the player would not start serving.<br>

<br>

* major crash fixed when diving unnecessarily;<br>

<br>

<br>

* major gameplay: drop volley was too easy, by just pulling the mouse<br>

&nbsp; backwards. Intuitively, in real tennis, if the opponent's
shot is<br>

&nbsp; very powerful, it is difficult to do a drop volley. But it
wasn't<br>

&nbsp; difficult in Free Tennis.<br>

<br>

&nbsp; This is now solved as follows: I introduced a "minimal shot
power"<br>

&nbsp; that depends on the speed of the opponent's shot. The power
of your<br>

&nbsp; volleys should not be less than this minimal power. If you
try to<br>

&nbsp; shorten the shot so that the power becomes less than the
minimal<br>

&nbsp; power, the height over the net is decreaased, and the ball
is likely<br>

&nbsp; to hit net.<br>

<br>

* major gameplay: dive is now reasonably easy to execute. It does not<br>

&nbsp; hit the net by default, but is like any other volley (except
you<br>

&nbsp; have to press D to execute it). This is now acceptable
because doing<br>

&nbsp; drop volley is not so easy anymore (see above).<br>

<br>

* major gameplay: by just pulling backwards on a groundstroke, it was<br>

&nbsp; too easy to turn it into a dropshot that bounces backwards,
and is<br>

&nbsp; therefore unreachable. This is not so easy anymore
(increased the<br>

&nbsp; minimum distance of the bounce from the net).<br>

<br>

* major gameplay: tuned difficulty of passing shots and volleys;<br>

&nbsp; passing was too difficult. Fine-tuned some player skills as<br>

&nbsp; well. Players now have different speeds at net and back, in
order to<br>

&nbsp; better simulate their skills and height.<br>

<br>

<br>

* major gameplay - camera logic: sometimes, when you were decentered<br>

&nbsp; horizontally, you were unable to see the court corner and
therefore<br>

&nbsp; could not aim properly. This is now fixed.<br>

<br>

* major gameplay: sprinting in the right direction is now easier: you<br>

&nbsp; can slightly alter the running direction _during_ the sprint.<br>

<br>

* bug fixed: in two player mode, the client player was unable to aim<br>

&nbsp; service properly (the mouse response was flipped - left went
right<br>

&nbsp; and viceversa).<br>

<br>

* crash fixed when doing dropshot that bounces backwards.<br>

<br>

* AI: when taking the net, the computer was covering too much the<br>

&nbsp; diagonal, and too little the downtheline.<br>

<br>

* AI: on passing shot, the computer now aims close to the line even if<br>

&nbsp; the skill level is low. (Passing shot makes no sense if not
close to<br>

&nbsp; the line.)<br>

<br>

* AI: the computer was doing some very long shots even in low<br>

&nbsp; difficulty setting.<br>

<br>

* gameplay: in realistic mode, tuned the parabola visibility.<br>

<br>

* AI: attackers have a better attacking logic: now they can choose<br>

&nbsp; to attack with a power shot (as opposed to an approaching
shot).<br>

<br>

<h2>New in 0.2</h2>

<br>

* compilation: made Makefile portable. If you had problems compiling<br>

&nbsp; Free Tennis, please give it another try.<br>

<br>

* gameplay: fixed bug where mouse sensitivity would depend on refresh<br>

&nbsp; rate, making the player too slow or too fast at some refresh<br>

&nbsp; rates. If your player was too slow or too fast, try again.<br>

<br>

* fixed crash: the game would crash when entering tiebreak.<br>

<br>

* score: games are now displayed on the screen (previously, only<br>

&nbsp; points were).<br>

<br>

* AI, gameplay: improved the logic to decide the shot<br>

<br>

* AI: the computer now aims service;<br>

<br>

* gameplay: there is a new sprint system: when you press X, the<br>

&nbsp; current mouse direction is locked, and the player starts<br>

&nbsp; sprinting. As long as you keep X pressed, the player keeps
sprinting<br>

&nbsp; in that direction, regardlessly of mouse movements. When you
depress<br>

&nbsp; X, sprinting ends.<br>

<br>

* graphics: the available sprint energy is now displayed in a vertical<br>

&nbsp; yellow bar.<br>

<br>

* score: fixed bug: on 7-5, the set would not finish.<br>

<br>

* graphics: the clay court has a better texture. the previous one was<br>

&nbsp; too light.<br>

<br>

* fixed bug in hotspot calculation. Some animation frames would have<br>

&nbsp; wrong position, resulting in jerky animation.<br>

<br>

* graphics: more player animations (the players run instead of sliding)<br>

<br>

* renamed command line options: -p0name to -p0 and -p1name to -p1.<br>

<br>

* fixed crash: sometimes the players attempted to hit a ball below the<br>

&nbsp; ground, and the game would crash. Thanks to Tuukka Hastrup
for the<br>

&nbsp; report.<br>

<br>

<br>

* gameplay: volees were unrealistically powerful<br>

<br>

* gameplay: in realistic mode, the parabola was invisible for volleys.<br>

<br>

* learnability: displaying a hint to press either F or G to grab the<br>

&nbsp; mouse input.<br>

<br>
