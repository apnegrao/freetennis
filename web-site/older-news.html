<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">15 nov
2005.</span> The changelog from 0.3.7 to 0.3.15 is finally
available. The reason for the delay is a problem with Sourceforge.</p>

<p>The manual was updated to reflect recent changes.</p>

<p>Updated the FAQ.</p>

<p><b>7 nov 2005. </b>Today I made some
sparring with a friend of
mine, via LAN, and discovered some major flaws in gameplay. Mostly this
is about drop volleys being too easy, and passing shots and dives being
too difficult. These problems have been&nbsp;fixed now. See the
changelog to know how exactly.</p>

<p>Some crash was fixed too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These improvements are already in CVS (or will be in a
few hours). See the changelog for the full list.</p>

<p>The FAQ was also updated with some hints for newbies.</p>

<p><b>4 nov 2005.</b> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Version
0.2 released. </span>See the changelog for the list of
improvements.</p>

<p>Added a <a href="file:///dat/pub/src/by-mau/freetennis/web-site/faq.html">FAQ</a>
page.</p>

<p>Please use the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=503536">forum</a>
for feedback and questions of general interest, so they remain for
future reference.</p>

<p><b>3&nbsp;nov 2005.</b> There are some
major changes in CVS. See the changelog.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you were not able to compile the game, it might be
because
some dependencies were missing from the instructions. I have updated
the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/freetennis/freetennis/INSTALL.txt">install.txt</a>
file.</p>

<p>I still need to test the network game and tune-up the
gameplay. In order to
do
it, <b style="font-style: italic;">I need volunteers to
play with me via netplay</b>.
Please contact
me. Do it!</p>

<p><b>1 nov 2005. </b>The&nbsp;version in
CVS has a complete score system (does not crash on tiebreak, and
displays games). See the <a href="file:///dat/pub/src/by-mau/freetennis/web-site/cvs.html">download</a>
page for instructions how to get the CVS version.</p>

<p>Added the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/freetennis/freetennis/CHANGES.txt">changelog</a>,
which shows the difference between versions.</p>

<p><b>31 oct 2005</b>. Version 0.1 released.
The computer AI is quite developed and playable, but not yet finished.
The computer does not aim service and is a bit repetitive. </p>

<p>In human-vs-human mode, however, the game is very
enjoyable.</p>
