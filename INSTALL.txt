This is a guide to compile and run the program.

Debian Sarge or Ubuntu Breezy
-----------------------------

With your package manager (probably Synaptic), install the following
packages:

libcamlimages-ocaml-dev
libsdl-ocaml-dev
libsdl-gfx1.2-dev
libsdl-mixer1.2-dev
libsdl-image1.2-dev
libsdl-ttf2.0-dev
liblablgl-ocaml-dev
liblablgtk2-ocaml-dev
libgdk-pixbuf2


(This will also install many dependent packages, among which the ocaml
compiler.)


---

Unpack the archive freetennis-xxxx.tar.bz2. Enter the directory
"freetennis" which will have been created.

Type

    make


The ocaml compiler will be invoked and the program should be compiled
without errors, and a new executable called "freetennis" should appear
in the current directory.


---

To run the game, type

./freetennis -newbie


For an additional list of options, see the manual (on the web site or
in the source distribution).



Other distros
-------------

Install the packages ocaml, lablgtk2, lablgl, camlimages, ocamlsdl
(the actual package names could be different).
